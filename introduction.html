					</br>Before you play, it's important to have an understanding on UFO's game mechanics.
						This page will cover everything you need to know about the game, including the UFO system, the game's main scoring system, which is also used for survival resources, the point item value system, and more.
						Keep in mind that this goes in to a lot of detail, and you don't need to know absolutely everything.
						Also, if you've played other Touhou games, you'll most likely know a lot of the information given here already.
						
					</br></br><font size="5">Controls</font>
					</br>If you need this section it's probably because you're new to Touhou, in which case play another game first. 
						This is very much not a beginner friendly game, play it once you already have a few Touhou 1ccs.
						However, I'll still explain it anyway.
						The controls are as follows:
					</br>Shift: Focus (Slow movement)
					</br>Z: Shoot
					</br>X: Bomb
					</br>Down/Numpad 2: Move Down
					</br>Up/Numpad 8: Move Up
					</br>Left/Numpad 4: Move Left
					</br>Right/Numpad 6: Move Right
					</br>Numpad 7: Move Up and Left
					</br>Numpad 9: Move Up and Right
					</br>Numpad 1: Move Down and Left
					</br>Numpad 3: Move Down and Right
					</br>Esc: Pause
					</br>Ctrl: Skip Dialogue
					</br>Home/P: Take Screenshot
					
					</br></br><font size="5">Menus</font>
					</br>Shown Below: The game's title screen and main menu
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/mainmenu.png"></img>
					</br>In the menus, press Z to select and X to go back.
					
					</br></br>Game Start: Rather obviously, this starts the game.
						After selecting this, you will have to select a difficulty:
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/difficultyselect.png"></img>
					</br></br>And then a character:
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/reimucharacterselect.png"></img>
					</br></br>And then a shot type:
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/reimua.png"></img>
					</br></br>After this, the game will start.
					
					</br></br>Extra Start: Starts the Extra stage, which is unlocked after you 1cc the main game.
						This is basically the same as Game Start, but the only difficulty option is Extra Stage.
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/extraselect.png"></img>
					
					</br></br>Practice Start: This is the game's practice mode.
						You will have to select a difficulty, character, and shot type, just like in game start, and then it will bring you to this menu where you select a stage:
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/stageselect.png"></img>
					</br>The Extra stage can not be played in practice mode without the use of a practice patch.
					
					</br></br>Replay: Here you can watch replays.
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/replayselect.png"></img>
					</br>Replays allow you to watch previous runs.
						Once a replay is selected, you have to select a stage.
						The replay will start from this stage. Selecting Stage 1 will start the replay from the beginning of the game.
						
					</br></br>Result: This tells you the statistics of your previous play, such as the amount of times you've used a shot type, how much time you've spent using it, and how many times you've cleared the game with it.
						It also displays your top 10 scores for each shot type and difficulty.
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/results.png"></img>
					</br>The shot type can be changed with the left and right arrows, and the difficulty can be changed with the up and down arrows.
						Pressing Z will bring you to pages of your spell capture histories.
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/spellhistories.png"></img>
					
					</br></br>Music Room: Here you can listen to the game's music.
						That's all there is here.
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/musicroom.png"></img>
					
					</br></br>Option: This is for adjusting the game's volume and configuring controllers.
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/options.png"></img>
					</br>To configure a controller, go to Key Config:
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/keyconfig.png"></img>
					</br>Default will reset all options to their default setting.
					
					</br></br>Quit: Exits the current menu, and exits the game when selected from the main menu.

					</br></br>Some information is added during bosses:
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/hud2.png"></img>
					</br>① Boss Health Bar
					</br>② Boss Name
					</br>③ Boss Phases Left
					</br>④ Spell Timer
					</br>⑤ Spell Name
					</br>⑥ Spell Capture Bonus
					</br>⑦ Spell Capture History (Times Captured/Number of Attempts)
					</br>⑧ Enemy Marker
					
					</br></br><font size="5">Stage Portions</font>
					</br>Any time you are not fighting a boss or a midboss, you are in a stage portion.
						During these, you'll fight various small enemies.
						This is also where you get most of your items. 
					
					</br></br><font size="5">Bosses</font>
					</br>A boss is fought at the end of every stage.
						Bosses are major enemies, and their fights can last several minutes.
						Bosses are divided into phases, which usually have 1 non-spell and 1 spell card
						Each pattern has a timer, and when it runs out, the pattern just simply ends and the next pattern starts.
						A pattern's timer running out has no penalty survival wise, but spell cards usually have a score penalty for timing out.
						Some spell cards are required to be timed out, most notably the Extra boss's 9th spell.
						A spell card is "captured" when you get the spell capture bonus, which is done by no miss no bombing the spell without timing it out.
						Required timeout spells still count as captured if they are timed out.
						
					</br></br><font size="5">Midbosses</font>
					</br>The concept of a midboss is quite simple, it's basically a short boss fight in the middle of a stage.
						That's really all there is to say about them.
						
					</br></br><font size="5">Stages</font>
					</br>UFO's main game is divided into 6 stages, and has an Extra stage that is unlocked by 1ccing the game.
						
					</br></br><font size="5">Difficulties</font>
					</br>As with most other Touhou games, UFO has 4 difficulties, Easy, Normal, Hard, and Lunatic.
						Easy is, obviously, the easiest difficulty, and is intended for beginners.
						Normal is the difficulty most people play on.
						Hard is, also obviously, a higher difficulty intended for more experienced players.
						Lunatic is the game's highest difficulty, and what the best players usually play on.
						The Extra stage doesn't have difficulties, and is usually counted as a separate difficulty on its own.
					
					</br></br><font size="5">Items</font>
					</br>There are 8 types of items in UFO:
					</br>Small Power Items: Increase your power by 0.01
					</br>Point Items: Give you points
					</br>Large Power Items: Increase your power by 1.00
					</br>Life Pieces: Give you 1 life piece (4 needed for an extend)
					</br>Bomb Pieces: Give you 1 bomb piece (4 needed for an extra bomb)
					</br>1up Item: Instantly gives you an extend
					</br>Bomb Item: Instantly gives you an extra bomb
					</br>Full Power Item: Instantly gives you full power (4.00)
					</br></br>Shown below: The eight items in UFO.
						From left to right: Small power, point, large power, life piece, bomb piece, 1up, bomb, full power.
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/ufoitems.png"></img>
					
					</br></br><font size="5">Point of Collection</font>
					</br>The point of collection is an invisible line high up on the screen.
						Above this line, all the items on screen will be collected automatically.
						Going above the PoC line is referred to as "PoCing"
						Previous Touhou games require full power for the PoC to be used, but in UFO, it can be used regardless of power.
						(Note: This applies to all games since MoF.)
						
					</br></br><font size="5">Resources</font>
					</br>Resources are your lives and bombs.
						You start off the game with 2 lives and 2 bombs, and get another every 4 life or bomb pieces.
						Lives are lost by getting hit by an enemy or a bullet, and bombs can be used by pressing X.
						When you die, your bombs will be reset to 2, unless you have more than 2, in which case you will have as many as you had previously.
						The main way of getting resources back is by summoning red and green UFOs, but you also get life pieces whenever you beat a midboss or boss.
						The midbosses don't drop life pieces if you time out or skip their final pattern, and the Stage 4 midboss drops either a 1up item or a full bomb.
					
					</br></br><font size="5">Playable Characters and Shot Types</font>
					</br>UFO has 3 playable characters, each with an A and B variant, for a total of 6 shot types.
					</br></br>Playable Character 1: Reimu Hakurei
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/reimucharacterselect.png"></img>
					</br>Reimu has the smallest hitbox and graze box in the game, as well as the slowest movement speed.
					</br></br>Reimu A
					</br>Shot: Persuasion Needle
					</br>Bomb: Dream Sign "Wild Exorcism Dance"
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/reimua.png"></img>
					</br>Reimu A is a forward focus shot, meaning she mostly just shoots straight forward. 
						Her high damage output, small hitbox, and high-power bomb make her a great choice for survival play.
						She's the most popular choice for No Bomb runs, and one of the most popular for regular 1ccs.
						However, she has the 2nd lowest scoring potential due to her small graze box.
					</br></br>Reimu B
					</br>Shot: Homing Amulet
					</br>Bomb: Spirit Sign "Fantasy Seal"
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/reimub.png"></img>
					</br>Reimu B is a basic homing shot.
						Her damage output is lower than Reimu A's, making her worse at bosses, but her homing makes her better at stage portions.
						One of Reimu B's biggest struggles is killing UFOs, because her homing bullets tend to hit enemies instead.
						Reimu B also has the lowest scoring potential in the game, being the only shot type without a Lunatic 3b.
						This is because she has the same issue as Reimu A with their smaller graze box.
						What makes her worse than Reimu A for scoring, however, is her bomb, which is basically useless for scoring.
						Reimu B's lower damage output also hurts her scoring potential, as she can't get as much spell capture bonus.
						Overall, Reimu A is generally considered to be a better choice than Reimu B for basically everything.
					
					</br></br>Playable Character 2: Marisa Kirisame
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/marisacharacterselect.png"></img>
					</br>Marisa has the largest hitbox and graze box, and the fastest movement speed.
					</br></br>Marisa A
					</br>Shot: Illusion Laser
					</br>Bomb: Bomb Sign "Master Spark"
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/marisaa.png"></img>
					</br>Marisa A is a forward focus shot like Reimu A, but her lasers are piercing, meaning they can shoot through enemies.
						In terms of survival, Marisa A is basically a worse version of Reimu A, due to her larger hitbox and slightly lower damage output.
						Where Marisa A really shines, however, is scoring.
						Marisa A has one of the highest scoring potentials, and famously had the game's overall world record from 2012-2014 with shin's Lunatic 3.292b.
						
					</br></br>Marisa B
					</br>Shot: Super Shortwave
					</br>Bomb: Magic Sign "Ultimate Shortwave"
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/marisab.png"></img>
					</br>Marisa B is a rather unique shot type.
						She's a spread shot, but she can also shoot behind her.
						Marisa B is by far the hardest shot type to 1cc with, due to her large hitbox, low damage output, and lack of iframes from her bomb.
						However, she has the 3rd highest scoring potential.
						Her main weaknesses in comparison to Marisa A are her lower damage output and worse bomb for scoring.
					
					</br></br>Playable Character 3: Sanae Kochiya
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/sanaecharacterselect.png"></img>
					</br>Sanae has a larger hitbox and graze box than Reimu but smaller than Marisa, and her movement speed is in them too.
					</br></br>Sanae A
					</br>Shot: Sky Serpent
					</br>Bomb: Snake Sign "Orochi of Ancient Times"
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/sanaea.png"></img>
					</br>Sanae A is another homing shot, but her homing works differently than Reimu B's.
						Instead of just going directly to an enemy, Sanae A's snakes will go straight then turn 90 degrees when at an enemy's vertical position.
						Sanae A suffers from the same issues as Reimu B, with her lower damage output in comparison to other shot types and struggling to break UFOs.
						She is better for scoring though, having the 4th highest scoring potential in the game.
					</br></br>Sanae B
					</br>Shot: Cobalt Spread
					</br>Bomb: Frog Sign "Wily Toad"
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/sanaeb.png"></img>
					</br>Sanae B is considered by many to be the best shot type in the game.
						She's a spread shot with a high damage output, a very dangerous combination.
						Sanae B's full power shotgun is the highest damage output in the game, excluding bombs.
						Her bomb also has high power and clears the entire screen.
						She also has a similar scoring potential to Marisa A and has had the overall WR since 2014.
						One of Sanae B's greatest strengths for scoring is the fact that you can graze during her bomb. 
						This is especially useful on Ichirin's final spell, which, at a high level, requires bombing to graze the lasers in Unzan's eyes.
						Some other shot types have this advantage, but Sanae B's is the most notable.
					
					</br></br><font size="5">Power</font>
					</br>Your power determines how much damage your shot does.
						Power can't go below 1.00 and can't go above 4.00.
						Your damage only increases with every new integer.
						For example, 1.99 power does the same damage as 1.00 power.
						Power is increased by collecting power items, and it decreases by 1.00 when you die.
						However, you also get up to 0.07 back immediately, as you drop 7 small power items when you die.
					</br></br>Here's a chart of the maximum damage per second of each shot type at every level of power:

					</br>*Marisa A has a glitch which causes her lasers to do the unfocused damage while focused. 
						Just simply start shooting unfocused, and then focus. 
						The game will not update the damage.
					</br>**It's impossible to deal maximum damage with Marisa B while unfocused at 3 or 4 power because of her options that shoot behind her.
					</br>***Sanae B's damage output works differently than the other shot types.
						The numbers provided for Sanae B are just the damage dealt directly by her bullets hitting the enemy.
						The frog explosions do 4 damage per frame.
						
					</br></br><font size="5">Nueball</font>
					</br>Nueball is a name given to the Stage 4 and 6 midboss.
						It's special in that it's different from all the other midbosses.
						Its pattern is neither a spell or a non-spell, and has no timer.
						However, it is a forced timeout pattern.
						It will spawn many small fairies that shoot bullets, which is the pattern you have to dodge.
						Nueball also doesn't give life pieces.
						Instead, it gives a full life in Stage 4 if you no miss no bomb, and a full bomb if you do die or use a bomb.
						In Stage 6, it will drop a full power item if you don't have full power, and a large power item and many point items if you do.
						
					</br></br><font size="5">Basics of the UFO System</font>
					</br>The UFO system is the main mechanic of the game, and is the most important thing to learn for effective gameplay.
						Throughout the game, there are UFO tokens.
						There are four types of tokens, red, green, blue, and color changing.
						The three colored tokens, generally referred to as static tokens, will always stay the same color, and the color changing tokens will cycle between each of the three colors.
						The cycle for color changing UFOs is static, blue will always come after red, green will always come after blue, and red will always come after green.
						These tokens will warn you when they're about to change by flashing.
						A color changing token can be held, causing it to not change colors, by being near it.
						This can also be used to make it last on screen longer, but this doesn't work for static tokens.
						When 3 tokens of the same color are collected in a row, a UFO of the same color will be summoned.
						However, if 1 token of each color is collected in a row (for example, red immediately followed by green immediately followed by blue), a rainbow UFO will be summoned.
					</br></br>Shown below: The three colored UFOs as they appear when summoned
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/coloredufos.png"></img>
					</br></br>Now, let's talk about each of the four UFOs and what to do when they're summoned.
						Red UFOs are the most commonly used for survival, and they give life pieces. 
						4 life pieces are needed to get an extend.
						Green UFOs give bomb tokens.
						Just like with life pieces, 4 bomb pieces give you an extra bomb.
						Rainbow UFOs give color changing UFO tokens.
						Blue UFOs are exclusively used for scoring, and we'll go into a more in-depth explanation later when we explain how to use the UFO system for scoring.
						In order to get these items, you have to break the UFO.
						The UFOs have a health bar and a timer. 
						To break the UFO, just reduce the health bar to 0 before the timer runs out.
						If the timer does run out, the UFO will go off screen and you will lose the items.
						Also, when the timer reaches 7 seconds, the UFO will move to your horizontal position.
						Additionally, there is a ring around the UFO when it is summoned. This fills up as the UFO collects items, and you get something extra.
						When a red UFO is filled up, it will give an extra life piece.
						Green UFOs, instead of giving an extra bomb piece, give a full bomb.
						Rainbow UFOs just simply give another color changing token, and blue UFOs will increase the score multiplier.
						The UFO doesn't need to be broken to get these items, with the exception of the blue UFO's score multiplier.
					</br></br>Shown below: A fully filled blue UFO with the timer at 6.16 seconds
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/ufoexample.png"></img>
					</br></br>Really, that's all you need to know for survival. Everything past this point mostly just applies to scoring.
					
					</br></br><font size="6">Scoring</font>
					</br>UFO has several ways to increase your score. 
						Minor score increases are dealing damage to enemies, collecting items, spell bonuses, and clear bonuses.
						Your main source of score will be increasing your point item value and summoning UFOs.
						
					</br></br><font size="5">Building a Survival Base</font>
					</br>Before you start scoring, you must first be good at survival.
						In UFO scoring, you'll be sacrificing lives by summoning less red UFOs in order to score higher.
						Because of this, you'll have much fewer lives to clear than in a 1cc.
						I'd recommend being able to at least No Bomb your category before you score.
						
					</br></br><font size="5">Using Spell Cards for Score</font>
					</br>Spell cards are a surprisingly significant source of points.
						Every spell card has a spell capture bonus (SCB), which is awarded when you no miss no bomb a spell without timing it out.
						The SCB starts at several million points and decreases over time.
						To maximize your spell capture bonus, just kill the spell as fast as possible.
						On some spells, most notably timeout spells, the SCB never decreases and they will always be worth their maximum value unless you die or bomb.
						Spells are worth more in later stages and on higher difficulties.
						Spell cards start at [2,000,000 * (Stage number + Difficulty value)] with the difficulty value for Easy being 0, Normal being 1, Hard being 2, Lunatic being 3, and Extra being 4.
						Byakuren's spells on Lunatic start out at 18,000,000, or [2,000,000 * (6+3)].
						All spells in the Extra stage are worth 22,000,000, because Extra gets counted as Stage 7.
					
					</br></br><font size="5">Clear Bonuses</font>
					</br>Clear bonus is awarded to you at the end of every stage.
						The way most clear bonuses work is simple, it's the number of the stage multiplied by 1,000,000.
						So for example, clearing Stage 4 awards a Clear Bonus of 4,000,000.
						Stage 6 and the Extra stage work differently, because those bonuses are for clearing the game.
						The clear bonus awarded in Stage 6 changes depending on difficulty, but all of them factor in the amount of lives and bombs in stock, your power, and your point item value.
						Here's a chart for how each difficulty's clear bonus is calculated:
					</br></br><table style="width:100%">
								<tr>
									<th>Difficulty</th>
									<th>Formula</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Easy</th>
									<th>(Lives in stock * 500,000) + (Bombs in stock * 250,000) + (Power * 1,000,000) + (PIV * 100) + 6,000,000</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Normal</th>
									<th>(Lives in stock * 1,000,000) + (Bombs in stock * 500,000) + (Power * 1,000,000) + (PIV * 100) + 6,000,000</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Hard</th>
									<th>(Lives in stock * 2,000,000) + (Bombs in stock * 1,000,000) + (Power * 1,000,000) + (PIV * 100) + 6,000,000</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Lunatic</th>
									<th>(Lives in stock * 3,000,000) + (Bombs in stock * 1,500,000) + (Power * 1,000,000) + (PIV * 100) + 6,000,000</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Extra</th>
									<th>(Lives in stock * 3,000,000) + (Bombs in stock * 1,500,000) + (Power * 1,000,000) + (PIV * 100) + 7,000,000</th>
								</tr>
							</table>
					
					</br></br><font size="5">Point Item Value</font>
					</br>The point item value (PIV) is the <i><b>maximum</b></i> value of each point item.
						Point items are collected at their maximum value when collected by PoCing, or when collected by a UFO.
						The value gradually decreases as items are collected lower on the screen.
						When a point item is collected, a small number will appear where it was.
						When collected at its maximum value, this number will be yellow.
						The value at which your point item value starts changes depending on the difficulty.
						Easy starts at 5,000, Normal starts at 10,000, Hard starts at 15,000, and Lunatic and Extra start at 20,000.
						There are three ways to increase your PIV.
						These are grazing, collecting tokens during a summon, and cancelling bullets.
						Grazing increases your PIV by 10 for every 10 graze you get (so 49 graze increases your PIV by 40 and 50 graze increases your PIV by 50).
						Collecting a token during a summon increases your PIV by 1,000.
						The PIV increase from bullet cancels is very small and basically irrelevant.

					</br></br>Actually, the way the game tracks PIV internally is a bit confusing.
						You may notice that the graze desyncs from the PIV increase. 
						This is because the PIV is tracked with a larger number than your actual PIV.
						This number, divided by 100, and rounded down to the nearest 10, is your actual PIV.
						1 graze increases this number by 100, and collecting a token increases it by 100,000.
						The PIV gain from bullet cancels is what causes the increase from graze to desync.

					</br></br><font size="5">The Importance of Graze</font>
					</br>At top level, graze is the largest source of PIV.
						Without actively going for more graze, the most you can score is only around 2,000,000,000.
						Although most of the large grazes are reserved for high scoring runs (as in, over 2b, sometimes even higher), it's still something you should care about when you start scoring.
						An easy way to gain more graze is to time down non-spells, as they have no score penalty for being timed out.
						A single graze that gives a ton of graze is often referred to as a supergraze.
						In UFO, these are most notable on Ichirin, who has a few patterns that can give over 10,000 graze (increasing your PIV by over 10,000 as well!)
						Some easy grazes include the Kogasa first non safespot and Shou 3rd non spins, both of which are often used in survival runs as well.
						
					</br></br><font size="5">Using Items for Score</font>
					</br>Obviously, point items are the most important items for score. 
						Point items should be collected as high on the screen as possible, or collected by a UFO or with PoCing.
						Power items give a small bonus when collected at full power, but this is only 10 points.
						We'll get in to how you can score with power items in the next section.
						
					</br></br><font size="5">Using the UFO System For Scoring And a More In-Depth Explanation</font>
					</br>Earlier I explained the basics of the UFO system, down to everything you need to know for survival, but there's a lot more to it than just what I explained there.
						First off, every enemy will drop the same token every time!
						This means you theoretically could just memorize which enemies drop tokens and which ones they do.
						Enemies that drop tokens are also colored differently to ones that don't.
						(With the exception of 1 enemy before the Stage 4 midboss that's colored as if it drops a token but actually doesn't, for some reason.)
					</br></br>Shown below: A normal big fairy (left) and a big fairy that drops a UFO token (right)
					</br><img src="https://theblueufocorner.github.io/images/introduction/ufoenemycolors.png"></img>
					</br></br>Additionally, color changing tokens will always start as the same color. 
						The first one in the game starts blue, and always will start blue.
						This holds true of the tokens dropped by rainbow UFOs, which always start as the color of the token last used for the summon.
						Using the same example in the basic explanation of a red, then green, then blue summon, the tokens dropped by the rainbow summoned from that combination will always start blue, because the blue token was the last one to be collected.
					</br></br>And now for the meat of what this section's about, scoring.
						Basically, summon as few reds and greens as possible and as many blues and rainbows as possible.
						In the basic explanation, I mentioned something called a score multiplier.
						This is a value that multiplies the value of all the point items collected by a UFO.
						The formula for the score you get from a summon is [Number of point items x Point item value x Score multiplier].
						For example, a UFO that's broken with 100 point items, a point item value of 50,000, and score multiplier of x8.0 will be worth 40,000,000 points.
						(100 x 50,000 x 8.0 = 40,000,000.)
						When broken, the UFO will spawn an orb, which must be collected to get your points. 
						Normally this orb is collected automatically, but if you die before it gets to you you'll have to collect it manually.
						I also mentioned that a blue UFO's multipier increases when it is filled. 
						A blue UFO broken when unfilled will have a x6.0 multiplier, and when filled it will have a x8.0 multiplier.
						x6.0 and x8.0 are the two highest possible multipliers, which are why blue UFOs are generally the best for scoring.
						The multiplier increase happens with green rainbow UFOs as well.
						For green UFOs, the multiplier is x1.0 unfilled and x2.0 filled, and for rainbow UFOs, it's x3.0 unfilled and x4.0 filled.
						Rainbow UFOs also switch power items and point items, making them better for sections with a lot of power items.
						The score multiplier of red UFOs works differently.
						Red UFOs have a x1.0 multiplier normally, and a x2.0 multiplier when broken at full power.
						Red UFOs also have a mechanic similar to rainbow UFOs switching items, but it works slightly differently.
						Power items are counted as point items, but you get the power items back when the UFO is broken, as opposed to rainbow UFOs which turn them in to point items that you don't get back.
					</br></br>It's worth noting that, without summoning any red UFOs, you get a maximum of 5 lives +1 extra life piece.
						This comes from the 2 lives you start with, the extra tokens collected from beating bosses and midbosses (which you don't get if you time out the last pattern), and the extend given for no miss no bombing Stage 4 Nueball.
						Also, because you only get 1 extra token, you should always summon an even number of red UFOs. 
						If you summon an odd number, you'll end the game with 3 life pieces, and one of those red summons will have been wasted because you wouldn't get an extend from it.
						This also harms your score, because red (and green) UFOs are the least valuable for scoring.
						You also want to get your red UFOs out of the way as soon as possible, while your PIV is still low.
					</br></br>Collecting tokens while a UFO is already summoned increases your point item value by 1,000.
						The color changing tokens from rainbow UFOs can be collected before the UFO is broken for an easy 1,000 PIV.
						Because of this, rainbows are often a better choice than blues in the early game, even when there's more point items than power items.
